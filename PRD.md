Product Requirements Document

"The Why"; Product requirements, benchmark metadata table, high-level requirements, etc. Defines the benchmark goal, validation objective, test name, benchmark number, category, and high-level success criteria.

## Benchmark Matrix Document Metadata (via benchmark_specification.json)

This PRD.md section is populated from benchmark_specification.json, which is the structured source of benchmark-specific product requirements.

## Workload Number
313

## Workload Name
GUPS Random Memory

## Execution Summary (Run and Measure)
Compile an embedded C OpenMP GUPS kernel with gcc and run it under perf stat for dTLB and LLC misses when perf is available. NumPy random updates run only if gcc fails. Derive gups from the elapsed update count, to measure random update rate

## Main Goal
Measure random 64-bit memory updates with a compiled C OpenMP kernel

## Validation Objective
Validates GUPS throughput and TLB/L3 miss rates from the compiled C OpenMP kernel. NumPy runs only if gcc is missing or the build fails

## Workload Category
Memory, Bandwidth & Data Movement

## Validation Requirement

The benchmark must include an automated SQLite-integrated validation layer that verifies persisted results from `results/benchmark.db`. Validation must confirm:

1. The benchmark run completed successfully with no tool errors.
2. Required samples and aggregate metrics were persisted for every swept shape.
3. Metrics are finite and physically sensible (positive, within plausible bounds).
4. Measured values satisfy configured thresholds when the workload defines pass/fail gates.
5. The benchmark fails validation when required data is missing, invalid, or outside bounds.

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Automation | Runs to completion without manual intervention after `bash run_benchmark.sh` |
| Idempotency | Re-running `run_benchmark.sh` appends a new run; never corrupts existing rows |
| Persistence | All metrics survive script exit; `results/benchmark.db` is the durable record |
